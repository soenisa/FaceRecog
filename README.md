# FaceRecog
Celebrity facial + "gender" recognition program

This is a program I did for my Introduction to Visual Computing class. The objective of the assignment was to create a facial recognition program using the [FaceScrub](http://vintage.winklerbros.net/facescrub.html) dataset and using the eigenfaces of a training set to compare input images to. A second method in the program detects whether a face is more masculine or feminine.

A report for the assignment is included in the repository detailing the results of the facial recognition program as well as the masculine/feminine facial detector program. It can be accessed [here](Project Report.pdf)
